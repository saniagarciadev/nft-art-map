# NFT Art Map

We've created an interactive UI mockup for the web app and mobile versions.

We've built a working prototype of the web app, where users can login with their real Tezos-compatible wallet, see a few placeholder NFT artworks, as well as adding new location-based images that will then be displayed on the map.

We've been working with the Tezos Berlin team to implement the smart contract logic that will allow for the minting of NFTs directly from the map, as well as the retrieval of the user's collected artworks.

See our backlog/roadmap in the project submission for more on the features we're currently working to implement.
